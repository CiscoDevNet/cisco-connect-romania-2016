[Cisco Spark] [3] is a cloud service providing persistent chat, room-based collaboration, WebRTC video conferencing, and more. Developers can easily integrate solutions with Spark via the [Spark REST API] [4] - for example to add Spark messaging features to an app user interface, or to automate sending Spark messages to rooms based on business system or real-world events.

Application developers integrating with Spark can easily bring messaging capabilities into their applications via a few basic REST requests. In this lab we will launch the Spark web client, then use the Google Chrome based REST test tool [Postman] [5] to execute APIs for creating a new Spark room, adding a participant to the room, and posting a new test message with an attached image file.

If you already have a Spark account, skip to step 3:  [Spark lab exercises](#3. Spark lab exercises)

1. From the Spark home page at [https://web.ciscospark.com] [] enter your email address, and follow the instructions for creating a Spark account. Note: you will need to access your email account, as Spark will send a 'You have a Cisco Spark account' email message with a 'Create Password' verification link - this must be completed in order to login to Spark.

2.	Log in to Spark and take a quick look around. Feel free to create a new room and invite a friend (note: they will need to complete the email verification step, too.)

3.	For more information on Spark features and benefits, check out [http://www.webex.com/ciscospark/] []
